  Example:<br />
  <pre>
FontCreator C:\Windows\Fonts\ARIALUNI.TTF 80 "My Fonts\ArialNumsIt" -max 512 -noASCII -chars "0123456789" -italic -bold 30</pre>
  That will generate files:<br />
  <ul>
    <li>My Fonts\ArialNumsIt.TFN</li>
    <li>My Fonts\ArialNumsIt_00.tga</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Options details</h3>
  <p>
    I use the Freetype library for font rendering, it might support formats other than
    TTF but I haven't tried them.</p>
  <p>
    Use double quotes around parameters that contain spaces. Especially important for
    filenames.</p>
  <p>
    For font sizes and DPI settings, I have followed Photoshop's conventions.</p>
  <p>
    Bold and italics are "fake" deformations of the character bitmap; for the real effects
    you need separate source font files. The optional parameter supplied to -italic
    and -bold are a percentage of the total character width, and can be negative to
    invert the effect. A bold parameter of -100 can't be used.</p>
  <p>
    Charset files are regular text files, either classic 8-bit characters or 16-bit
    Unicode (UCS-2 Big Endian or Little Endian). You can add as many text files as you
    want. Use -noASCII if you only want characters you supply directly (via -chars or
    via charset files). FontCreator will not duplicate characters in the resulting font
    regardless where they come from.</p>
  <p>
    Codepages are... well, it's a long and confusing topic. Ignore it and it will use
    the system defaults. Use -cp "C" to avoid any translation. In Windows, you can use
    -cp ".1252" (notice the leading dot) for the Latin-1 codepage, -cp ".1255" for Hebrew,
    etc. You can find a list of Windows codepages at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/cscp.htm">
      http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/cscp.htm</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/unicode_81rn.asp">
        http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/unicode_81rn.asp</a>,
    and more info in general at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepage</a>.
    I have no idea how this works in other operating systems. Codepage settings are
    active at the point where they are specified, so if you have an 8-bit charset file
    called "file1.txt" and write:</p>
  <pre>
FontCreator ... -cp ".437" file1.txt -cp ".850" file1.txt</pre>
  <p>
    then the charset file will be read twice, and interpreted differently each time.
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">If you have any trouble, don't use -cp and
      supply Unicode charset files instead.</span></p>
  <h2>
    File Formats</h2>
  <p>
    The TFN file is a plain text file where you can find the the list of texture files
    and the parameters for each character in the font.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first line contains the number of textures, the number of characters, and
      the font height (suggested distance between lines of text).</li><li>The following lines contain the names of each texture file (without path or extension), and the dimensions of the texture</li><li>Finally, there is a line for each character, of the form:</li></ul>
  <pre>
Unicode advance offsetX offsetY TextureIndex TextureU TextureV Width Height</pre>
    <p>
      The Unicode is hexadecimal (for example, 0x0020 would be the space ' '). Everything
      else should be pretty much self-explanatory. To draw a character, draw the rectangle
      (TextureU, TextureV, Width, Height) from the TextureIndex texture, at the position
      (X + offsetX, Y + offsetY), then add "advance" to X, repeat this for each character
      in your string. When going to the next line, just add the font's "height" to Y.</p>
  <p>
    The TFN file is deliberately minimalistic in structure. It is designed like that
    to minimize loading complexity. It contains the texture dimensions as a helper in
    case you later postprocess the TGAs and change their size - you need the original
    dimensions in order to interpret the TextureU and TextureV of the characters.</p>
  <p>
    The TGA files are saved as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8bit -&gt; grayscale TGA</li>
    <li>24bit -&gt; normal BGR TGA</li>
    <li>32bit -&gt; normal BGRA TGA, RGB are all white and font is in the alpha channel</li>
  </ul>
